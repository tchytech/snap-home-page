## Welcome to My Frontend Mentor Challenge! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my front-end coding challenge. This project was completed as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges, which help developers like me improve their coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To accomplish this challenge, I utilized my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build the intro section with dropdown navigation and make it look as close to the provided design as possible. I ensured that users could:

- Access the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
